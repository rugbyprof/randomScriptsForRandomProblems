## Argc Argv Example

Example cpp program showing use of command line params. Why? It's a pretty ubiquitous
setup that you see in lots of snippets. OK, Maybe not so much with the newest C++'s (14 and 17)
but knowing about ARGC and ARGV is a must!

Beyond the argc/argv idea of passing params to your main function, just having the ability to 
"configure" or parameterize your programs is very convenient thing to have since it allows you 
to use them just like a function! 

### Files

- [argcArgv.cpp](argcArgv.cpp)
  - Example usage of command line params in a cpp file
- [count.cpp](count.cpp)
  - Another of a cpp program to count lines, words, and characters. Could be used like `wc` (just not as good). It is just an example of passing a file in from  command line.
- [last_of_the_mohicans.txt](last_of_the_mohicans.txt)
  - Text file to count. Just an example, input path could be anywhere in file system.
