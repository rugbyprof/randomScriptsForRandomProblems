## Random Scripts for Random Problems

I'm not sure what this repo really is. I get requests to talk about coding for "stuff" that we don't necessarily learn in a typical cs courses. I threw the word **"scripting"** into the title because: 

- We are not really writing full fledged prorgrams that require lots of design or organization. 
- The programs are "one offs" that do something for us one time (really fast) and possibly never used again. 
- They can involve running shell commands (terminal commands for you noobs).
  
So lets look at a little more defined term of "scripting":

>A script or scripting language is a computer language with a series of `commands` within a file capable of being executed **without being compiled.** 

So in a generic sense, its just a list of instructions to perform a task. Also we use scripting languages which is a programming languge that is not compiled. I got some stats from [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021) (Stackoverflow's developer survey) about some of the most popular scripting languages . In order of popularity here is a list of languages I've used before and some conmfort with:



| Rank | Language<sup>1</sup>     | My Competance |
| :--- | :----------- | :-----------: |
| 1    | JavaScript   |<img src="https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/zcloud/zcloud-files/stars_3.png" width="75">|
| 2    | Python       |<img src="https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/zcloud/zcloud-files/stars_4_half.png" width="75">|
| 3    | SQL<sup>2</sup> |<img src="https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/zcloud/zcloud-files/stars_3_half.png" width="75">|
| 4    | Bash / Shell |<img src="https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/zcloud/zcloud-files/stars_3_half.png" width="75">|
| 5    | PHP          |<img src="https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/zcloud/zcloud-files/stars_4_half.png" width="75">|

- <sup>1</sup> Theres are some others that I havent listed like Node.js which is a superset of javascript and also MongoDB which works well with javascript / Node but I'm sure how to classify it.
- <sup>2</sup> Sql is technically a scripting language, but I don't see us using it. Maybe if we use SQLite we can.

#### Advantages of scripts:
- Does not require the file to be compiled (but may be when necessary).
- Easy to learn and write.
- Easy to port between different operating systems.
- Fast development to solve problems (depending on the language and the number of **libraries** that are available).


#### Projects

This is really up to everyone who attends. I'll add more as we start to add projects.
