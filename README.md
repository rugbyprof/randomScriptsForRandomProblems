## Random Scripts for Random Problems

I'm not sure what this repo really is. I get requests to talk about coding for "stuff" that we don't necessarily learn in typical cs courses. I threw the word **"scripting"** into the title because: 

- We are not really writing full fledged prorgrams that require lots of design or organization. 
- The programs are "one offs" that do something for us one time (really fast). 
- They can involve running shell commands (terminal commands for you noobs).
  
So lets look at a little more defined term of "scripting":

>A script or scripting language is a computer language with a series of `commands` within a file capable of being executed **without being compiled.** 

So in a generic sense, its just a list of instructions to perform a task. ALSO: You use scripting languages (a programming languge that is not compiled). I got some stats from here about some of the most popular scripting languages https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021. In order of popularity here is a list of languages I've used before:



| Rank | Language     | My Competance |
| :--- | :----------- | :-----------: |
| 1    | JavaScript   |<img src="https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/zcloud/zcloud-files/stars_3.png" width="75">|
| 2    | Python       |<img src="https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/zcloud/zcloud-files/stars_4_half.png" width="75">|
| 3    | SQL          |<img src="https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/zcloud/zcloud-files/stars_3_half.png" width="75">|
| 4    | Bash / Shell |<img src="https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/zcloud/zcloud-files/stars_3_half.png" width="75">|
| 5    | PHP          |<img src="https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/zcloud/zcloud-files/stars_4_half.png" width="75">|


#### Advantages of scripts:
- Does not require the file to be compiled (but may be when necessary).
- Easy to learn and write.
- Easy to port between different operating systems.
- Fast development to solve problems (depending on the language and the number of **libraries** that are available).


#### Projects

This is really up to everyone who attends. I'll add more as we start to add projects.
